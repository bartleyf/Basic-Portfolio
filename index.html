        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets\images\profile.jpg">
        <p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio until breaking out on my own in Central Texas. In 2003, I moved to San Marcos, Texas and began my college career at Texas State University. I graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor of Public Administration. Shortly after graduation I went to work at the Univeristy of Texas System in the Office of Governmental Relations. While working for UT System I graduated with a Master of Public Administration from Texas State. I also hold a certificate in project management from UT Austin. </p>
        <p>I currently live in Buda, TX with my wife, Calysta, and daughter, Amelia.</p>
